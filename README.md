# CandyStats
Examines the game Candyland through graphing, shapiro testing, t-tests and more. Created to answer whether or not the order of players solely determines the order of winners.

Still under construction, I am using this project to look into how to data science strategies to analyze something simple like candyland so I can possibly look into more complex and interesting situations in the future.
